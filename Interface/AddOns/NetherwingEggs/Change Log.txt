== v3.04 - 23rd February 2019
* NEW egg at (74.20,82.39)!

* reinstate booleanTrue code
* Adjust a couple of build version checks
* Removed one unused zhTW translation

* NEW egg at (72.59,83.73)
* VERIFIED egg at (69.10,88.22) with double precision
* Undocumented from v3.02: build number test is now properly numeric. Once we hit build "10" (currently "8" for BfA) my string equation logic would have failed
* Removed pre-BfA code from ResetPins function (as ResetPins only invoked for 8.0+)
* Fix fatal error if attempt to resize prior to first view of the World Map

* Removed unnecessary string.upper
* Expansion check now actually can occur if running Vanilla
* 6th Icon (the blue flying boot) replaced with a better "mana orb". Looks much better
* Added 14th "Screw" icon. This to establish a common / useful set across all my AddOns
* Renamed "Dragon's Eye" to just "Eye" for the same reason (as also the default for my Raptor AddOn)
* numTextures renamed to num for same reason

* Handle "upvalue" problem for players running Vanilla / Lua 5.0 and whom wish to at least include this AddOn in their collection
* Fix for problem of Instance maps not behaving like normal maps and thus breaking OnUpdate register/deregister event code

== v2.01 - 5th April 2018
* OMG! New location in the Mine! (67.95,82.47)

* PlaySoundKitID removed as of Patch 7.3.0. Replaced by PlaySound

== v1.23 - 26th August 2017

* Standardised with other of my AddOns: When Control key is down, NO NEED for "show coordinates" option to be on. I.e. link in chat (with coordinates) regardless
* Visibilty check for index [1] before Hide/Show of all icons = aids efficiency / fps
* Menu allows an option to be enquired upon and not just changed
* "Macro Commands" in the command menu, whilst technically correct, has been renamed to the more sensible "Commands"
* Double quotes used by both World Map and Minimap in chat, for consistency
