- Temporarily cleaned up some logic for 'Contains' which returned progress information for itself... which is probably not necessary now that the search results are actually accurate prior to building the Contains text

    Reduced indentation of our main search function

- Flight paths no longer overburden the addon when looking at a Taxi Node NPC for the first time per continent when you have hardly any cached.

- Parser now supports a number of new preprocessor commands for its Lua database.  
    You start a command with this: -- #if  
    The follow it up with a condition like this: CLASSIC, TBC, WRATH, SHADOWLANDS, etc  
    And then write some code to execute for the condition.  
    Then finish it off with a -- #else, -- #elseif, -- #elif, or -- #endif.  
    You can nest and chain however many conditions as you want!

- Modified logic of the Source information for 'Contains' entries to not show when literally looking at the Item container or NPC which contains the Items  
    Source information for 'Contains' entries will now include the source Profession name for those items which are Crafted  
- Headers once again can use Quests and get checked off as saved. (I didn't realize how prevelant this was.)  
- Optimized the Item object type by factoring out the Collectible as Cost behaviour after no usage of itemIDAsCost was found. (by replacing the meta)
